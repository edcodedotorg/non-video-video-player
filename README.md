# Non-video Video Player
## A vibe coded fake video player that "plays" content that can be easily generated by LLMs and edited by humans.

### Setup

This tool can be loaded with a dev server. To enable video export you need to enable headers.  I've provided instructions for Microsoft's Live Preview extension for VSCode. https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.live-server.

(e.g. right click the html files and select "Show Preview" then click the hamburger/three-lines and click "Open in Browser")

### Enable Video Export

A VideoExporter error can occur because the VS Code Live Server extension does not enable the necessary security headers by default. FFmpeg.js (v0.11.x) relies on SharedArrayBuffer, which modern browsers block unless the site is "Cross-Origin Isolated".

To fix this, you must manually configure Live Server to send the COOP and COEP headers.

#### Fix VS Code Live Server Settings
Open Settings in VS Code (Ctrl + , or Cmd + ,).

Search for Live Server > Settings

Click Edit in settings.json.

Add the following object to your configuration:

```
"liveServer.settings.CustomHttpHeaders": {
    "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
    "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp"
}
```
